    <h1>Today's News</h1>
    <h2>Highlight</h2>
    <p class="milk-bombs">Hello veiwers, today, there was a milk explosion at 54th street today at 5 pm. Supposedly there was supposed to be a guard, guarding the milk bombs, 
        but a criminal had slipped past, and detonated a MDD (Milk Destroying Device), which exploded almost all of the milk bombs and had a range of impact of 50 kilometers. 
        The CEO, Beff Jezos says that he did not plan for this to happen, more on the Milk incident later.</p>
    <h2>Secondary News</h2>
    <p class="fake-robbery">A robbery occured at 9:68 pm today at the Lorem & Sons bank, or so they thought. The 69 year old man in reality was holding everyone hostage with a bannana, which was painted to look
        like a gun, which he then gifted everyone in the bank 120,000 dollars, he was later found on his boat fishing and was arrested for having a "gun". The lawyer later then proved his innocence, and he got a quarter of a million dollars
        since he was a war veteran, and for a thanks. He was badly damaged in the Milk explosion later that day. <br><br><em><b>(Read Milk Bombs on page 1 for more information)</b></em><p>
